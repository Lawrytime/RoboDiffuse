ROS2 (Humble) Setup
=========================

##     Set locale

Make sure you have a locale which supports UTF-8. If you are in a minimal environment (such as a docker container), the locale may be something minimal like POSIX. We test with the following settings. However, it should be fine if youâ€™re using a different UTF-8 supported locale.

`locale  # check for UTF-8`

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales`
`sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8`
`sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
`export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`

`locale  # verify settings`
